# Activity: repeat a word read from the user input
Write a C-program that prints out a word as many times as specified. The number of repetitions and the word should be given as input to the program. You may assume that the word has no more than 100 characters (be sure to also reserve space for the null terminator, \0, though!).

## Example



Input:
```c
2 Hello

```
Output: 
```c
Hello
Hello
```
Example 2:

Input:
```c
4 thing

```
Output: 
```c
thing
thing
thing
thing
```
<!-- Example 3:
```c
100

```
output:

```c
6
``` -->

### Solution:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char word[101] ;
  int numberoftimes , i;
  scanf("%d %s" , &numberoftimes , word);
  for ( i = 0; i < numberoftimes; i++)
  {
    printf("%s\n" , word);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
    
```

code reviewer solution :
```c

same as mine , with only minor changes of order of code or the name of variables

```
