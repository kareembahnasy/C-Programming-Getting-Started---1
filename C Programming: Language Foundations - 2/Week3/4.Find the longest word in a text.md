# Activity: Find the longest word in a text
Your job is to find the length of the longest word in a text with no punctuation or special characters of any kind - only contains words. To do so, please write a C-program that takes as a input first the number of words in a text, followed by all of the words in the text. The output of your program should be the length of the longest word in the text.

To simplify your program, you can assume that the longest word will not exceed 100 characters.

 

## Example



Input:
```c
14
This is a simple example text
we have to find the largest word length
```
Output: 
```c
7
```
Example 2:

Input:
```c
7
All cats are grey in the dark
```
Output: 
```c
4
```
<!-- Example 3:
```c
100

```
output:

```c
6
``` -->

### Solution:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char name[50];
  int i = 0 ,evenorodd;
  scanf("%s" ,&name);

  while (name[i] != '\0')
  {
    i++;
  }
  evenorodd = i % 2;
  if (evenorodd == 0)
  {
    printf("1");
  }
  else{
    printf("2");
  }
  
  

  return 0;
}
    
```

code reviewer solution :
```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int numWords, maxLength = 0, currLength = 0;
  char word[101];

  // Get the number of words
  scanf("%d", &numWords);

  // Read and process each word
  for (int i = 0; i < numWords; i++) {
    scanf("%s", word);

    // Find the length of the current word
    currLength = 0;
    while (word[currLength] != '\0') {
      currLength++;
    }

    // Update the maximum word length
    if (maxLength < currLength) {
  maxLength = currLength;
  } else {
  maxLength = maxLength;
}
  }

  // Print the length of the longest word
  printf("%d\n", maxLength);

  return 0;
}

```
