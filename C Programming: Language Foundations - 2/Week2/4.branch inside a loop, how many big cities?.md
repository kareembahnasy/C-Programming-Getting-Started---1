# Activity: branch inside a loop, how many big cities?
You want to determine the number of cities in a given region that have a population strictly greater than 10,000. To do this, you write a program that first reads the number of cities in a region as an integer, and then the populations for each city one by one (also integers).

 
## Example
There are 4 ingredients and they all have a different price per pound: 9.90, 5.50, 12.0, and 15.0. You must take 0.25 lbs of the first, 1.5 lbs of the second, 0.3 lbs of the third and 1 lb of the fourth. It will cost exactly $29.325000.

Input:
```c
6
1000
5000
15000
4780
0
23590
```
Output: 
```c
2
```
<!-- Input:
```c
4
9
```
Output: 
```c
Tinuviel
```
Example 3:

Input

```c
4
6
```
output:

```c
Uncertain
``` -->

### Solution:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numofcities , amountgreater , i,totalcities;
    scanf("%d" , &numofcities);
    for ( i = 0; i < numofcities; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d" , &amountgreater);
        if (amountgreater > 10000)
        {
            totalcities = totalcities +1;
        }
        
    }
    printf("%d" , totalcities);
    return 0;
}
```
