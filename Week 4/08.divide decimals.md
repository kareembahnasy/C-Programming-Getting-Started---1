# Activity: divide decimals
You just started learning a new language and decide to buy a few books to practice. Thankfully you quickly find a book seller who offers every book for the same low fixed price. You have a certain amount of money and you would like to know how many books of the same price you can purchase.

Please write a C-program that starts by reading the amount of money you have (which may be a double), then reads the price per book (which again may be a double). The program should then display an integer, namely the largest number of books that you can purchase with the given amount of money. 
 

## Example
Input:
```c
48.0
3.50
```
Output: 
```c
13
```
Input:
```c
27.0
5.0
```
Output: 
```c
5
```

### Solution:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    double moneyIhave , bookprice , noofbooks;
    int Dnoofbooks;
    scanf("%lf %lf", &moneyIhave , &bookprice);
    noofbooks = moneyIhave / bookprice;
    // printf("%lf" , noofbooks);
    Dnoofbooks = (int) noofbooks;
    printf("%d" ,Dnoofbooks);

    return (0);
}
